# BlogPost-NLP-and-Sentiment-Analysis

# Motivation and goals

I completed a natural language processing task for a Fortune 500 company as part of my MSc. Prior to starting, I had no education or experience in NLP tasks, so I had to teach myself everything I needed to know from scratch. The company I worked for is well established and quite old, so it was not ‘born’ into technology. As a result, I had no data science team to rely on and worked on my own.

This brought up a lot of challenges. One specific difficulty I faced was that “I didn’t know what I didn’t know”. In other words, I was not aware of what the pipeline of an NLP project looked like, what libraries were useful in this space or how I was going to apply what I had in my ML toolkit to text data.

This series of blog posts is my attempt at explaining, both in theory and in practice, what NLP is, what a bird’s eye view of an NLP project looks like and how the major steps are implemented. I frame the analysis using Amazon data on their Video Games category. The link to this can be found in Notebook 1, before any analysis is implemented.

There are three individual posts in this series in the form of Jupyter Notebooks:

- Part 0: A bird's eye view of NLP in the context of Sentiment Analysis & Text Classification
- Part 1: Tokenising and Pre-processing textual data
- Part 2: Methods of text vectorisation, also known as feature representation

# How to run this project

- Download the Jupyter notebook
- Download the data files using the link provided
- Ensure you import all the required modules. The code for this is already present in the Notebooks
- Change paths to load the data from your local machine once you have downloaded the data files mentioned in point 2
- Run the Jupyter Notebooks
